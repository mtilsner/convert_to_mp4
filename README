This will be small script to convert HD MKV files to MP4 without having to transcode the video track.
The audio track will have to be reencoded to AAC since MP4 does not support AC3 encoding.
This tool requires "mkvinfo", "mkvextract", "ffmpeg", and "MP4Box" to be available in your system bin path.
